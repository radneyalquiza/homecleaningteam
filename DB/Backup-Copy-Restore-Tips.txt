BACKUP DATABASE:
- Using MSSQL Management Studio, right click on the database, select TASKS then GENERATE SCRIPTS.
- Make sure that you select SCRIPT ALL OBJECTS to get the DATA (INSERTS) as well.
- There will be a .sql file that will be produced. This script can be run on the new database/copy.

PROJECT:
- Delete the Model.edmx and Model.tt.
- Uncomment/Remove the connection string in the Web.config file.
- Create a new Model.edmx and Model.tt with any database copy you want (local/remote).
- For general testing, USE LOCAL. For performance, USE REMOTE.

LOCAL DATABASE COPY:
- If you have a database backup sql file, simply connect to .\sqlexpress and freely
  create a database with the same name as your remote database so that your Entities identifier
  doesn't get messed up.
- Once the local database is created, run the database backup script file.

LOCAL TO REMOTE:
1. Create scripts of table and data through Management studio.
2. Re-run scripts made from creating scripts from Local db.
3. (If table names become messed up, delete all tables and re-run scripts)
4. Delete model and tt, then reconnect the database through VS2012.
